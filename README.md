```
This method ensures that when the window is closed, the client disconnects from any network resources and the application exits cleanly.

```
isValidIPAddress(String ip)

This method checks whether a given IP address is valid by attempting to resolve it using the InetAddress.getByName() method. If the IP address can be resolved, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

```
